# Human-Computer Interaction Project

This project was created for the course **"Human-Computer Interaction"** during my studies at NTUA. The goal of this project is to explore and apply principles of HCI through the development of a mobile application prototype. We focused on user-centric design, usability testing, and efficient UI/UX practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter & Dart:** For building the mobile app's frontend, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and smooth user experiences.
- **Figma:** For designing and prototyping the user interface. Figma allowed us to iterate on design, conduct user testing, and receive feedback efficiently before implementation.

## Project Overview

In this project, we followed a user-centered design process:

1. **Research & Ideation:**  
   We began with user research to identify key pain points and needs. Based on this, we defined the features and functionalities of the application.
   
2. **UI/UX Design:**  
   Using Figma, we created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the app layout and interactions. We conducted several rounds of usability testing to ensure the interface was intuitive.

3. **App Development:**  
   The app was developed using Flutter, utilizing Dart for building the logic and components. This ensured smooth performance on both Android and iOS platforms.

4. **Final Testing:**  
   The app underwent rigorous testing to ensure it met both usability and technical performance standards.

## App Description

This project is a fitness tracking app designed to serve as a comprehensive fitness journal. Users can:

- Create custom workout routines.
- Create meal plans.
- Set fitness goals and track progress toward achieving them.
- Log their workouts.
- Track their meals and monitor energy levels throughout the day.
- Track their performance in workouts.


The app provides users with insights into personal fitness data, helping them understand what works for them and what doesnâ€™t. It offers a holistic view of their fitness journey, aiding in informed decision-making about health and wellness.
